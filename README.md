# CA675 Assignment-2

## Welcome to MyBnB!

Mybnb is the the app that you need to get to grips with Airbnb in your area and find out how much you could make by signing up to host. 

Mybnb utilises publicly available Airbnb data. It allows you to view what other properties are like in your neighbourhood, other neighbourhoods and gives the user the opportunity to find out how much money they could make on Airbnb through use of our newly created model.

This visualisation is the output to our Cloud Technologies app construction assignment. All code/data used in the project can be found on GitHub below.
